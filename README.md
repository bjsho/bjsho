### [ORB - Ores are back](https://github.com/orbmcmod/orb)
A Minecraft mod that makes ores drop the good old ores, no raw ores. The fortune enchantment won't be applied to the ores as well.
This mod also has mod extensions for [Create](https://github.com/orbmcmod/orbc) and [BYG](https://github.com/orbmcmod/orbb)
